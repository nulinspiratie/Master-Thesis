      \subsubsection{Powersweep}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item If the resonator seems to disappear after the transition from dressed frequency to bare frequency (or vice versa), this is likely due to the qubit being extremely close to the resonator, and so the frequency shift is large.
        \end{itemize}
      \subsubsection{Spectroscopy}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item If the deviation in transmission becomes less due to more detuning, increasing the power can also increase the contrast.

    \subsection{Determining population in three states}
      \label{ssec:Determining population in three states}
      If there were no leakage present during randomized benchmarking, the full information about the state populations can be extracted from the randomized benchmarking results. However, if leakage to the second-excited state is present, the full information about the populations of the three states can be extracted using two versions of randomized benchmarking, one without a final pi pulse, and one with a final pi pulse. The final pi pulse swaps the populations in the ground and excited state. We assume that the population of the second excited-state remains unaffected by this single final pulse.

      Using these two randomized benchmarking sequences, two different signals $S_0$ and $S_1$ are measured, corresponding to a measurement without a final pi pulse, and a measurement with a final pi pulse, respectively. This leads to the following three equations:

      \begin{align}
        p_0 V_0 + p_1 V_1 + p_2 V_2 = & S_0 \notag\\
        p_1 V_1 + p_0 V_1 + p_2 V_2 = & S_1 \notag\\
        p_0 + p_1 + p_2 = &   1
        \label{eq:three populations equations App}
      \end{align}

      where $p_i$ corresponds to the final population in state $\ket{i}$, and $V_i$ is the signal of state $\ket{i}$.  Filling in $p_2 = 1 - p_0 - p_1$ into the first two equations of \ref{eq:three populations equations App}, we are left with the following set of equations:

      \begin{align}
        \begin{bmatrix}
          V_0 - V_2 & V_1 - V_2 \\
          V_1 - V_2 & V_0 - V_2
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
          p_0 \\
          p_1
        \end{bmatrix}
        =
        \begin{bmatrix}
          S_0 - V_2 \\
          S_1 - V_2
        \end{bmatrix}
      \end{align}

      This set of equations can be easily solved by matrix inversion, resulting in the following three populations:

      \begin{align}
        \begin{bmatrix}
          p_0 \\
          p_1
        \end{bmatrix}
        = &
        \left((V_0-V_2)^2 - (V_1 - V_2)^2\right)^{-1}
        \begin{bmatrix}
          V_0 - V_2 & -V_1 + V_2 \\
          -V_1 + V_2 & V_0 + V_2
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
          S_0 - V_2 \\
          S_1 - V_2
        \end{bmatrix} \notag\\
        p_2 = & 1 - p_0 - p_1
        \label{eq:RB populations using final pi}
      \end{align}
      If one has knowledge of all thee signals $V_0$, $V_1$ and $V_2$ (see Section~\ref{ssec:Second excited-state} for information on measuring $V_2$), the three populations can be obtained using \ref{eq:RB populations using final pi}.
