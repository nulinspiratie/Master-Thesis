\end{center}
The first part of this thesis discusses superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonators treated with a combination of deep-reactive ion etching and HMDS surface treatment. These treatments are aimed at reducing the loss due to two-level systems (TLS), which are suspected to dominate loss in the low-power, low-temperature regime. The combination of DRIE and HMDS results in an increase of quality factor an order of magnitude. The quality factors were consistently measured in excess of 1M at single-photon levels, showing that these are state of the art resonators. Power-dependent and temperature-dependent measurements however suggest that even after application of DRIE and HMDS, in the low-power, low-temperature regime the resonators are still limited by TLS.

In the second part of this thesis frequency re-use in combination with a vector-switch matrix is studied using transmon qubits in circuit QED. Using randomized benchmarking, gate fidelities of qubits sharing the same frequency were found reaching $99.9\%$, being limited by decoherence. Furthermore, the nanosecond-scale switches of the Duplexer allow individual control of both qubits simultaneously by directing pulses to either or both qubits. Three different realizations of two-qubit randomized benchmarking using selective broadcasting have been studied. All three methods achieve gate fidelities well in excess of $99\%$, thereby meeting the surface code threshold. Most notable is the $5$ primitives RB method, in which $5$ primitive gates are used to decompose any Clifford by selective directing of pulses. The $5$ primitives method can be applied to an arbitrary number of same-frequency qubits, while having a fixed overhead of $5$ gates per Clifford. This allows for efficient characterization of multiple qubits simultaneously, and could potentially have applications in large-scale quantum computers.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

During my master's project at the DiCarlo group I have had the great fortune of working together with an amazing group of scientists dedicated to building a quantum computer.

During my project I have been working very closely with Christian Dickel. His enthusiasm about all matter related to physics has had a contagious influence on me. His hard work and perseverance shows a dedication to his work unparalleled by most. I would like to thank him for all the help he has given me over the nine months, bringing the transmon from an abstract idea to something almost tangible. Although he did not start as my supervisor, he definitely ended as one.

I would also like to thank my supervisor Alessandro Bruno. It has been a great pleasure learning from him. His insights in fabrication, combined with his willingness to think outside of the box, have resulted time and time again in novel approaches to circuit QED. Alessandro has made me believe that no matter what the challenges are in building a quantum computer, with innovative minds there will always be a solution.

Leo DiCarlo initially planted the seed of quantum computing when I took his course a year earlier. His enthusiasm in teaching resulted in me deciding that it was an obvious choice to do my Master's project in quantum computing. During my project at the DiCarlo group Leo has definitely shown me what it means to do work, but more importantly he has shown me what it means to do good work. However, he also embeds the phrase "work hard, play hard", as his occasional guitar playing in the lab has shown. His made up lyrics never failed to make me laugh, especially when aimed at me. I would like to thank him for all the work he has invested in me, it has truly been a unique experience.

I would furthermore like to thank Nathan Langford, who has helped me many times over the past months. His detailed explanations of physics related subjects not only showed deep insight into the subjects, but also gave me the opportunity to glimpse at them. It has also been a pleasure working alongside Adriaan Rol, whose consultant-like workstyle brings structure and order into an otherwise sometimes hectic place. Stefano Poletto has also been an important person during my time at the group, who was the go-to guy when the Muxmon experiment showed strange results. His insights have helped a great deal in the progression of the experiment. Furthermore it has been great fun to work with Marios Kounalakis. Who knows, maybe one day I will even make you one of my sandwiches you have been preying for for so long. During my last months I have also had the luck of working with Ramiro Sagastizabal, who flew in from Marseille for a three month project, and who has helped me on numerous occasions. My thanks also go out to Florian L\"uthi. Although our projects never overlapped, our time in the lab did, and I definitely enjoyed the time. Furthermore I would like to thank Gijs de Lange, who unfortunately left us for a Yaler future after the DRIE project. Nevertheless during the time i have spent with him he has taught me a great deal, for which I am very grateful. I would finally like to thank Lieven Vandersypen and Stephanie Wehner for being part of my examination committee.

Aside from the people in the lab I would like to thank my parents who have throughout my life been a guiding light, and without whom I would definitely not be writing this thesis right now. I would also like to thank my girlfriend Judith, who was always able to keep my spirits up. My last word of thanks goes to my other friends, general as it may sound, I would like to thank each one of you.

\chapter{Introduction}

  Quantum circuits based on circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) have experience rapid development of the past few years. Especially transmon qubits, and variations thereof, have flourished up to the point where they are used to perform multi-qubit algorithms. Fedorov et al.~\cite{fedorov2011implementation} first demonstrated implementation of the Toffoli gate, a key ingredient for error detection schemes. The Grover's search algorithm, and the Deutsch-Josza algorithm have been demonstrated for two qubits by DiCarlo et al.~\cite{dicarlo2009demonstration}. Furthermore, the first quantum error detection algorithms have recently been implemented by C\'orcoles et al.~\cite{corcoles2015demonstration}, Kelly et al.~\cite{kelly2015state}, and by Rist\`e et al.~\cite{riste2014detecting}.

  There seems to be no inherent limit preventing a cQED-based quantum computing framework from scaling up to thousands, possibly even a million, qubits. One of the most promising quantum computing architecture is the surface code~\cite{bravyi1998quantum}. It has the advantage of having a relatively high fault-tolerance threshold, and only requires nearest-neighbour qubit couplings.

  That being said, even in an architecture such as the surface code, the challenges in scaling up are tremendous. Qubits are required to have long coherence times, high fidelity gates with a short duration, and must be arranged such that it is compatible with the architecture. Aside from on-chip challenges stringent requirements are placed on supporting equipment. The chip must be cooled down to the milikelvin temperature range, and each of the qubits must be individually controlled.

  My Master's project has been largely devoted to addressing some of the challenges accompanied with scaling up. To this end I have mainly been involved in two experiments, and so this thesis is separated into two parts.

  During the first three months of my Master's project I was involved in the characterization of high quality factor coplanar waveguide resonators. These resonators achieve their high quality factors through a combination of deep-reactive ion etching and HMDS surface treatment. High quality resonators are necessary for long coherence time qubits, as the quality factor places an upper limit on the relaxation time $T_1$ of a coupled qubit through the Purcell effect.

  In Chapter~\ref{ch:theory} the theory behind coplanar waveguide resonators is explained. The focus of this chapter is on the different loss mechanisms that reduce the resonator quality factor, and the different methods used to minimize these losses. The two methods making this experiment unique are the use of deep-reactive ion etching and HMDS surface treatment. In Chapter~\ref{ch:Results and discussion} the results are discussed. We find that quality factors over 1 million can be attained in the single-photon regime.

  The second and main part of my Master's project was spent on the Muxmon experiment. In this experiment two of the challenges in scaling up are addressed, namely frequency crowding and hardware efficiency. A key ingredient in this experiment is the Duplexer, designed by Duije Deurloo. The Duplexer is a vector switch matrix having four input channels and two output channels. It can control the signal through each of the input-output combinations, thereby selectively directing qubit pulses. This allows for selective broadcasting, which enables the control of two qubits simultaneously, consequently reducing the amount of instruments required. These subjects are discussed in Chapter~\ref{ch:Challenges in scaling up}.

  To test the concept of selective broadcasting two chips were created, the Muxmon0 and Muxmon1. Both chips consist of three qubits, two of which will be tuned to the same frequency, so that they can be controlled via the Duplexer. The two chips differ in the method used for driving qubits: the Muxmon0 uses direct drive lines, while Muxmon1 uses capacitively coupled drive lines. Chapter~\ref{ch:Muxmon device characterization} is devoted to the measurements performed to characterize the Muxmon chips.

  Since we want to know the best attainable qubit performance under these conditions the qubits must be accurately tuned. In Chapter~\ref{ch:Calibration routines} the calibrations used to tune the qubits are explained.

  Measuring the performance of the qubits is done through randomized benchmarking. This is a method based on repeated application of unitary operations on the qubit, from which the gate performance can be extracted. Using randomized benchmarking we show that we can control qubits simultaneously using selective broadcasting. Randomized benchmarking will be discussed in Chapter~\ref{ch:randomized benchmarking}.
