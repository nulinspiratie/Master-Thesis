        \item All three qubits have individual flux tuning
        \item Air bridges are used, not only for connect the ground planes, but also such that the feed line can pass over other coplanar waveguides without contact \\
      \end{itemize}

      \item Explain differences between Muxmon0 and Muxmon1.
      \begin{itemize}

            It has two resonator buses at \SI{4.9}{\giga \hertz} and \SI{5.0}{\giga \hertz}. \\
            These could also be used for two-qubit gates.
        \begin{description}
          \item[Advantage] Able to fully control each qubit individually, even when multiple qubits share the same frequency.
          \item[Advantage] Less coupling between data qubits.

                    Cross-coupling leads to transfer of excitation.\\
                    An associated coupling strength \textbf{g} can be associated to cross-coupling.\\
                    Can be determined by driving one qubit extremely hard, and measuring signal from other qubit.\\
                    \textbf{TODO:} Show values of cross-coupling found, or do this in characterization section \\
                    \textbf{TODO:} Leads to coherent errors? \\
                    \textbf{TODO:} Two types of cross-coupling? Direct leakage of pulse pulse, and transfer of excitation? cross-driving?
        \item[Readout cross-talk] Coupling between a qubit and a resonator that are not directly coupled.\\
                      A part of the signal measured from one resonator is then due to the state of another qubit \\
                      \textbf{TODO:} Understand more behind readout cross-talk
      \end{description}

    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Left to think about:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Should I already include items such as coherence times, the fact that Muxmon0 performs better than Muxmon 1?
      \item Where should I include coherence times versus frequency?
      \item Should the part on cross-coupling and readout cross-talk not be in characterization section?
      \item Should the section on the Duplexer go in here?
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Figures that need to be included:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Muxmon0 and Muxmon1 chip, preferably optical microscopy
      \item SEM image of air-bridges such that coplanar wave-guides cross without intersecting
      \item schematic of cross-coupling and readout cross-talk \\
          It could be good to create this using the actual Muxmon chip as background, with arrows indicating how the different effects operate
    \end{itemize}


  \chapter{Qubit characterization}
    This chapter gives a step-by-step description of how to find a resonator and qubit, and subsequently how to tune the qubit's parameters.

    In the design of cQED chips, the parameters of the qubits and resonators are always targeted which are ideal for the experiment.
    For coplanar waveguide resonators one can already obtain relatively good parameters for the required dimensions from simple formulae \textbf{TODO:} refer to formula.
    For superconducting transmon qubits, however, finding the right dimensions that correspond to the desired parameters is a much more complicated process.
    The qubit's frequency, for instance, depends on the qubit's coupling energy \Ec and Josephson energy \Ej. The coupling energy \Ec can be reasonably estimated from classical simulations. Finding the right dimensions for the Josephson junction that result in the desired Josephson energy \Ej, however, is difficult, and usually physically testing different junctions is necessary to determine an accurate conversion from the desired \Ej to the Josephson junction dimensions.

    Nevertheless, the actual parameters of the sample are almost never where one expects them to be. Once the sample is cooled in the dilution refrigerator, an inevitable hide-and-seek game follows with the goal of finding the frequency of the resonators and qubits, and subsequently determining their properties. This chapter describes the measurements that were performed to characterize the MuxMon samples.

    \section{Part I: Continuous-wave measurements}

      Once a sample is properly cooled down it is ready to be measured. At this stage the sample is still an unknown terrain, where the experimenter only has a rough map, containing the sample's targeted parameters, and the specific properties of the resonators and qubits.

      The first step is to look for signs of life. These manifest themselves as resonance frequencies of the resonators and the qubits that are coupled to them. As we are not yet interested in the properties of the resonators and qubits which can only be obtained through measurements with accurately timed pulses, we send continuous tones through the feedline, and measure deviations in the transmission. These measurements are known as continuous-wave measurements

      \subsection{Scanning for resonators}
        Since communication with the qubits is mediated through their coupling to resonators, the first step is to find these resonators. This is done using heterodyne detection, and has been explained in section \textbf{TODO:} Create section in Resonator chapter.

        \textbf{TODO:}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Explain why using a high power is good.
          \item Explain that the quality factor is low because the resonator is coupled strongly to the qubit (equation including coupling to qubit?)
        \end{itemize}

        \textbf{Figures:}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Figure of transmission showing all three Muxmon0 resonators
        \end{itemize}

      \subsection{Powersweeping the resonators}
        Once the resonators have been located, the next stage is to find the qubit that is capacitively coupled to each of the resonators. Due to this capacitive coupling the frequency of the resonator experiences a shift dependent on the state of the qubit. This shift disappears when the resonator is driven with sufficient power, in which case its resonance frequency shifts to the bare cavity frequency \fbare. If this frequency shift is observed, it indicates that the qubit is alive. Measuring this frequency shift is commonly done in a powersweep. A powersweep is a measurement in which a resonator scan is performed for a range of powers.


        A powersweep additionally provides information about at what power the resonator enters the \textbf{TODO:} nonlinear? regime. For measurements involving the qubit the readout power must be below this threshold power. Furthermore, from the frequency shift between the dressed cavity frequency and the bare cavity frequency, it is possible to estimate the amount of detuning between the qubit and the resonator. This is done through the relation: \textbf{TODO:} insert relation

        If no shift is observed, it could mean that the qubit is dead (e.g. because the Josephson junction is shorted). However, this is not necessarily the case. An alternative possibility is that the resonance frequency of the qubit is sufficiently far away from that of the resonator, and as a result the frequency shift cannot be discerned. At this point it is too early to draw conclusions, and we may almost draw the analogy with Schr\"odinger's cat in a box.

        \textbf{TODO:}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Explain better theory behind resonator shift $\chi$
          \item Explain theory behind transition to bare cavity frequency
          \item Refer to thesis Reed for more info on frequency shifts
        \end{itemize}

        \textbf{Figures:}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Powersweep of ancilla qubit
        \end{itemize}

          \begin{itemize}
            \item If the resonator seems to disappear after the transition from dressed frequency to bare frequency (or vice versa), this is likely due to the qubit being extremely close to the resonator, and so the frequency shift is large.
          \end{itemize}
